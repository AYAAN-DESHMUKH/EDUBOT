📝 Complete Project Summary Prompt
You are assisting in the development of EduBot — a personalized, offline-first AI tutoring application designed to make learning more engaging by connecting academic topics to a student’s personal interests (e.g., favorite superhero, movie, genre, and subject). 

The goal is not just to answer questions, but to explain concepts using relatable analogies from the student’s favorite fictional worlds — all while running entirely offline for privacy, accessibility, and reliability. 

🧩 Core Features & Implementation
Local AI Backend
Powered by Llamafile (a self-contained .llamafile executable).
Hosted via Docker using a custom image that bundles the Llamafile runtime.
Server runs at http://localhost:8080 with OpenAI-compatible API.
Models are stored in a local ./model/ folder (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf).
Build & Run Scripts
build_file.sh: Downloads the model (once), builds the Docker image.
run_server.sh: Reusable script to start the Docker container with proper volume mounting and port mapping.
No need to rebuild unless changing the Docker setup.
CustomTkinter GUI (Python)
Clean, responsive desktop interface.
Fully offline — no internet required after setup.
Includes:
Server control (Start Llama Server, status indicator)
Interest collection form:
Favorite superhero
Favorite movie/series
Favorite genre
Subject to learn (e.g., Physics, Math)
Chat interface with streaming responses
Dark/light mode toggle
Personalized AI Behavior
The system prompt is dynamically generated using the student’s interests.
The AI explains concepts using analogies from their favorite worlds.
Example: Use Iron Man’s suit to explain energy conversion.
Or Harry Potter spells to explain chemical reactions.
Tone: Friendly, encouraging, slightly humorous.
No PDF Processing
Removed to keep the app fast, open-ended, and focused on conceptual tutoring, not document Q&A.
Students can ask about any topic, not just what’s in a file.
Honest UX for Offline Performance
No thinking animation (too heavy or misleading).
Instead, a one-time friendly message appears at the start of the chat:
"💡 Heads up: I'm running offline on your device — not a cloud wizard, just a smart local model! So I might take a few seconds to think. But I promise, my answers are worth the wait. 😊" 
Sets realistic expectations without slowing down the UI.
Streaming Responses
Uses stream=True in the API call.
Messages appear token-by-token for a natural, conversational feel.
No blinking or flickering (fixed by updating labels in place).
Error Handling & Stability
Checks server status on startup.
Graceful fallbacks if Docker isn’t running.
Safe container cleanup on exit.
All dependencies are local: customtkinter, requests, PyPDF2 (optional), tkinter.
🚫 What We Avoided
❌ Cloud-based AI (e.g., GPT) — everything runs locally.
❌ Heavy animations or fake “AI thinking” effects.
❌ PDF parsing — too restrictive and slow.
❌ Complex state management — kept simple and readable.
✅ Development Status
✅ MVP fully implemented in edubot.py
✅ Works with Docker + Llamafile
✅ Ready for real-world student use
✅ Can be packaged into an .exe (via PyInstaller) for distribution
🛠️ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
Package as standalone .exe for Windows (no Python required)
Add voice input/output using speech_recognition and pyttsx3
Save/load student profiles
Export chat history as PDF
Multi-language support
💬 How to Continue
If this session expires, paste this entire prompt into a new chat. It contains all context needed to: 

Fix bugs
Improve UI
Add features
Rebuild the app
Explain the vision to a team
This is EduBot:
Not just another chatbot — but a personalized, offline, empathetic tutor that speaks the student’s language, literally and emotionally.

Let’s make learning feel less like school — and more like a conversation with a friend who gets you. 🚀📘✨
